						<h3><b> Junior Quality Assurance Engineer</b>, Trulioo</h3>
						<h4><b>May 2020-December 2020, May 2021-August 2021</b></h4>
						<p>I first worked at Trulioo for an eight month term, then later returned for my last co-op experience for a four month term. The first eight month term I never even entered the office due to Covid-19, while the second term I was able to work in the office a few times! My time at Trulioo helped me grow to be an efficient worker and I was introduced to the world of Agile Development. Being a QA was the best of both worlds for me as someone who enjoys working on interdisciplinary teams because I would work with both developers and product managers. Below are some of my best accomplishments while working at Trulioo:
						<li>Designed and implemented automated UI flow test cases using C# and Selenium to test user type privileges
						</li>
						<li>Created and improved over 200 automated API test cases to be run daily
						</li>
						<li>Built out sandboxes using JavaScript to test API calls using Postman
						</li>
						<li>Worked closely with Product Managers to ensure all design specifications were addressed
						</li>
						<li>Helped onboard new QA team members both with training and by creating technical documentation packages
						</li>

						<h3><b> Research Assistant</b>, UBC Department of Mechanical Engineering</h3>
						<h4><b>January 2019 - May 2019</b></h4>
						<p>My first ever co-op position was as a research assistant for the UBC department of mechanical engineering, specifically as a member of the run-out table group. In manufacturing of hot rolled steel products, run-out table cooling can change the microstructure and mechanical properties. During this co-op term I studied the microstructures of steel, designed and carried out experiments to determine the effects of various parameters on oxide scale formation on steel, and wrote a 27 page literature review paper on oxide scale formation on steel as a framework for future experimentation. Although I had a good experience working here, it ultimately allowed me to determine mechanical engineering is not one of my passions. I'm thankful I had the opportunity to learn this about myself!</p>
